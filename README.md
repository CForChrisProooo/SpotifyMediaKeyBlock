Spotify is annoying and likes to hijack the keyboard media keys, this cannot be disabled.
This Autohotkey script prevents Spotify from being able to interpret these keys and instead applies them to Chrome or other applications of use.
Tested with Hardware Accelaration disabled in Spotify on the non Windows Store Version.
